ll try to shrink-wrap its children along the horizontal axis. Setting a flex on a child (e.g. using Expanded) indicates that the child is to expand to fill the remaining space in the horizontal direction.
These two directives are mutually exclusive. If a parent is to shrink-wrap its child, the child cannot simultaneously expand to fit its parent.
Consider setting mainAxisSize to MainAxisSize.min and using FlexFit.loose fits for the flexible children (using Flexible rather 
han Expanded). This will allow the flexible children to size themselves to less than the infinite remaining space they would otherwise be forced to take, and then will cause the RenderFlex to shrink-wrap the children rather than expanding to fit the maximum constraints provided by the parent.

A widget which was marked as dirty and is still active wa
 scheduled to be built, but the current build scope unexpectedly does not contain that widget.
Sometimes this is detected when an element is removed from the widget tree, but the element somehow did not get marked as inactive. In that case, it might be caused by an ancestor element failing to implement visitChildren correctly, thus preventing some or all of its descendants from being correctly deactivated.
The root of the build scope was:
  [root]
The offending element (which does not appear to be a descendant of the root of the build scope) was:
  Expanded

Usually, this means that the Expanded widget has the wrong ancestor RenderObjectWidget. Typically, Expanded widgets are placed directly
inside Flex widgets.
The offending Expanded is currently placed inside a Semantics widget.
The ownership chain for the RenderObject that received the incompatible parent data was:
  Semantics ← IconButton ← Expanded ← Semantics ← Listener ← _ExclusiveMouseRegion ← _OverlayPortal ← OverlayPortal ← Tooltip ← Row ← ⋯

The following GlobalKey was specified multiple times in the widget tree. This will lead to parts of the widget tree being truncated unexpectedly, because the second time a key is seen, the previous instance is moved to the new location. The key was:
- [GlobalObjectKey<NavigatorState> _WidgetsAppState#7ad7c]
This was determined by noticing that after the widget with the above global key was moved out of its previous parent, that previous parent never updated during this frame, meaning that it either did not update at all or updated before the widget was moved, in either case implying that it still thinks that it should have a child with that global key.
The specific parent that did not update after having one or more children forcibly removed due to GlobalKey reparenting is:
- _FocusInheritedScope
A GlobalKey can only be specified on one widget at a time in the widget tree.
